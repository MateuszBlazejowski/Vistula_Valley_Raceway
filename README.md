Adding Custom Track Parts Guide

Tracks are automatically generated. You can add your own 'components' of tracks to the program.

Run the program with the filepath to the drawn track part

example: dotnet run my_track_part.txt

All track parts should start and end with the same width and placement

// TODO: Figure out exact limits (how wide/tall should the components be)
