## Project Description and Features
### Dev perspective
- The code follows object-oriented principles, ensuring modularity, reusability,     and maintainability. 
- Moreover, the code is well documented, improving readability. 
- Program runs on several threads, which is crucial for smooth player input. It also allows separation of graphic rendering and game logic. This concurrency benefits the game flow.
- Nearly every aspect of the game is customized by a player or can be easily changed in the code.  
- This includes number of cars, size of the frame, number of laps and shape of the track, maximum speed etc.
- Computer-controlled cars feature a simple but effective autonomous driving system.
- Colision system is implemented; it punishes the colision by decreasing the speed and moving you to the middle of the track.
### User perspective
- The game allows user to play using arrows to turn, accelerate and brake. 
- Objective is to win the race in previously set number of laps.
- Before starting, the player customizes their car, game settings, and even the trackâ€™s color scheme.
- The sense of speed is achieved by dynamically adjusting the console output framerate.
